This project, titled "Applying Weighted PageRank to Friendships on Social Media Networks," aims to explore the modeling of relationship strength between friends in social networks. The project utilizes the Weighted PageRank algorithm, an extension of the traditional PageRank algorithm, to rank the importance of friendships based on tie strength. The objective is to investigate how different heuristics for modeling tie strength impact the results of network analysis algorithms, specifically the PageRank algorithm. The project's methodology involves selecting a social media network dataset, developing heuristics to model tie strength, and running the modified PageRank algorithm with weights. The project seeks to evaluate the impact of different tie strength models on the ranking outputs and analyze the alignment with existing research on relationship strength in social networks.
